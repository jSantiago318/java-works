Yes, all the TA's helped me

Yes, the ring buffer was my biggest challenge. With some help of the TA's a
understood and finished Ring Buffer.
Guitar String and Guitar Hero where very time consuming since I did a lot of
trial and error with the code. Also, in Guitar String and error kept showing
that the Arrays in the buffer where either empty or full and the error
referenced Ring Buffer. The intetresting thing was that Ring Buffer appeared
correct in Tiger File. I found the bug, but I spent around 2-3 hours not
knowing what to do about the bug.
