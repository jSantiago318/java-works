Programming Assignment 5: Linear-Feedback Shift Register

Hours to complete assignment: 14


/**********************************************************************
 *  What is one advantage of making two separate classes for LFSR
 *  and PhotoMagic rather than putting everything in a single class?
 **********************************************************************/
    For the programmer its easier to have to classes that with different
    functions rather than one big file for to different tasks.

    N/A




/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you receive help from classmates, past COS 126 students, or
 *  anyone else? If so, please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA"
 *  or "Office hours on Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)
 **********************************************************************/

Yes, all the TA's



/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/

Yes, I got confused with bits. I thought I could implement funcitons with bits
when I made a new LFSR output, but it didn't work for me. Also, the bit that
printed out at the end wasn't the same as the assignment so I had a lot of
trial and error before I had it right. It was a challenging engineering
problem, so I tried tackling it as alone as I could. That made it harder to do.
Like with thte previous assignment, I overcomplicated the code and I had the
order of the array ant BitAt mixed up.
PhotoMagic was easy after working with LFSR.
